## How to become a contributor and submit your own code

### Signing Contributor License Agreements(CLA)

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.
 
 Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement
 (CLA).
 
   * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
     own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an
     [individual CLA](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/node/285/node/285/individual-signup).
   * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
     then you'll need to sign a
     [corporate CLA](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/?destination=node/285/organization-signup).

### Contributing A Patch

   * Sign a Contributor License Agreement, if you haven't already done so(see details above).
   * Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
   * Submit the pull request.
 
### Adding dependencies

If your patch depends on new packages, add that package with [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep).
